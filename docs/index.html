    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and efficiency in autonomous systems and human-robot interaction scenarios. Earlier studies primarily utilized sufficient observational data to predict future trajectories. However, in many real-world scenarios, such as the sudden emergence of pedestrians from blind spots, obtaining sufficient observational data remains difficult, making accurate prediction a persistent challenge and even contributing to traffic accidents. Therefore, advancing research on pedestrian trajectory prediction under extreme scenarios is critical for enhancing traffic safety. In this work, we propose a novel framework termed \textit{Diffusion$^\mathbf{2}$}, tailored for momentary trajectory prediction. \textit{Diffusion$^\mathbf{2}$} consists of two sequentially connected diffusion models: one for \textit{backward prediction}, which generates unobserved historical trajectories, and the other for \textit{forward prediction}, which forecasts future trajectories. Given that the generated unobserved historical trajectories may introduce additional noise, we propose a dual-head parameterization mechanism to estimate their aleatoric uncertainty and design an adaptive noise module that dynamically modulates the noise scale in the forward diffusion process. Empirically, \textit{Diffusion$^\mathbf{2}$} sets a new state-of-the-art in momentary trajectory prediction on ETH/UCY and Stanford Drone datasets.</p>
